# DayZ_Discord_Watchlist
A simple bot for creating a common watchlist and sending out notifications to Discord when a player comes online from the list

The bot receives data from CFTOOLS, therefor also provided the necessary authentification required.

To make this bot work you must:
- open the port for this app to receive data
- add a new webhook from CFTools to the bot-server address
- put the CFtools-token from the webook into the config

The script can handle multiple webhooks.
